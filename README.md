1. Project Title:

Digital Clock – Show Time in hh:mm:ss Format using Loops


---

2. Objective:

To create a simple digital clock program in C++ that continuously displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds (hh:mm:ss) format using loops and time control functions.


---

3. Project Description:

In this project, we design a digital clock simulation using the C++ programming language.
The program takes the initial time (hours, minutes, and seconds) from the user and then continuously updates the time every second.

The project uses loops to repeatedly display the time, and basic logic to handle the transition of seconds, minutes, and hours — just like a real clock.

The main features of this project are:

Display time in a formatted (hh:mm:ss) style.

Automatic increment of time every second.

Loop-based simulation that runs continuously.

Works in any C++ compiler.
